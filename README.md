# TempeSurveyReport
Overview
The city of Tempe, AZ has gathered survey data on employees. Iâ€™m going to load it into a postgres database and then analyze it using python, pandas, and sklearn. If I have time I will convert the pandas code to spark. The output of the project will be an automatically generated pdf based on the statistics of user selected questions.
